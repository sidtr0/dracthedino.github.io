In 2020, life slowed down a tad bit and having more time in my hands, I decided to pick up something which I always wanted to for years - I got into 3D modelling. At the time, my best friend, [Calcium](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBlueChalk) was a regular Blender user, dishin' out badass low poly Blender cars every week and truth be told, it looked very cool in my eyes and I wanted to make those things myself.

As is tradition in the Blender community, the first thing every beginner does is... make a donut. It seems to be the easiest thing ever and it somehow became a de facto "Hello World" of the 3D modelling world.

It was my first ever model and I was literally on cloud nine when I got onto the material shading stage. It was oh so exciting.

It all started with a pink colored plane, a brown colored deformed torus and a rather unrealistic strawberry flavored filling on top. Thank you, [Andrew Price](https://www.blenderguru.com/), very cool.

I was very much hooked into Blender by the time I finished the donut tutorial from Blender Guru, which I definitely would recommend to everyone who wants to start out Blender. But I was bored of making this, I wanted to create badass low poly cars like my friend. He recommended Imphenzia's low poly car tutorial to me and I ended up making a low poly Nissan GTR, which at the time I was very happy with.

Even if I wasn't very happy with the car itself, I was very proud of being able to make this. The next model I made was also a car and this one I made all by myself. Presenting before you, the most elegant car in existence, Chevrolet Camaro.

This was immediately a much better looking model in stark comparison to the Nissan GTR. At the time I didn't think too much of it but the secret of it all is too make proper continuous quad meshes! They really go a long way in making your model look realistic - even if its low poly. 

After this I somehow lost interest in this, went off doing programming but eventually came back to doing Blender when I was inspired by a YouTuber called [Ducky3D](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuNhGhbemBkdflZ1FGJ0lUQ), immediately falling in love with his art style. I started following some of his abstract renders and made some abstract designs, really different from what I am used to.

I was really happy with this one:

And my favorite of them all... Something about this really stands out to me and I am really very proud of this one.

I also did some experiments with procedural textures (can be seen above but my favorite one is this shirt and suit design).

Drifting away from these abstract designs, I wanted to try a photorealistic scene and I ended up making a room as realistic as possible. The models are all found online but the room and lighting and everything else is my work.

{% include figure image_path="./assets/images/room2.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="And this one too." %}

I was having fun with this scene but my poor laptop really wasn't having half as much fun as I did. I gave up this project halfway through but the above two renders really made it worth it in my opinion.

I did a few more abstract scenes, nothing very fantastic though so I am not going to show them here. But I am going to fast forward to last month when I finally decided to get into high poly car modelling. My first victim was the 2013 Tesla Model S and as a first time car, it went pretty smooth... mostly.

I never ended up making a scene around it or rendering it but I definitely learnt a lot about how not to make cars... but only in hindsight after I wrecked yet another car. My second victim with the above technique was the 2020 Aston Martin Vantage AMR. A symbol of beauty, power and elegance - in the hands of a newbie car modeller? What could possibly go wrong?

I am very sorry that you had to see this.

But it was still a minor improvement from what I did previously and that's the most important thing. You never know what works and what doesn't until you try it yourself. And I encourage you to make mistakes and see what happens and figure out how to rectify it. That's the most rewarding part of making 3d models because you can visibly see how your skills have improved over time. Just looking back at my donut scene, I can point out so many mistakes but I wanted to show that everyone starts somewhere and that's where I started. I am not the best but I am learning everyday and that's what makes this so fun - to see how much better you can get. 

I am currently working on a Chevrolet Corvette Stingray and so far, its probably the best model I have ever made.

Having learnt so much from my previous two cars, I am trying to apply a new technique in this one and while its not finished, I can tell this is going to better and that's very good.

The most important lesson I have learnt from a year of doing 3D is not to compare yourself to others because then you'd be setting yourself up for disappointment because there are people who have been doing this for years. It is very easy to do so because its very easy to compare visual elements. People learn at different speeds and its totally understandable. At least you know you're doing your very best and that's good. Show your more experienced friends and peers your renders and ask them to harshly critique it, you wouldn't believe how useful this is at times. And learn when to not overdo it. Show it to people who might not know anything about 3D and ask their opinions. Sometimes you might find out you've overdone one part of your scene and ignored another. 

All of what I said is definitely always applicable in other parts of life too but this metaphor in the 3D world really helped me see it better. I have spent the last year doing something I have really enjoyed and I am very happy about that.

Thank you.
