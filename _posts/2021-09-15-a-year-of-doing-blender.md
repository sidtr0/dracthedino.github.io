In 2020, life slowed down a tad bit and having more time in my hands, I decided to pick up something which I always wanted to for years - I got into 3D modelling. At the time, my best friend, Calcium was a regular Blender user, dishin' out badass low poly Blender cars every week and truth be told, it looked very cool in my eyes and I wanted to make those things myself.
