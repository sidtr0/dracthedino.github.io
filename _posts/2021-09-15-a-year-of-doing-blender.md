In 2020, life slowed down a tad bit and having more time in my hands, I decided to pick up something which I always wanted to for years - I got into 3D modelling. At the time, my best friend, Calcium was a regular Blender user, dishin' out badass low poly Blender cars every week and truth be told, it looked very cool in my eyes and I wanted to make those things myself.

As is tradition in the Blender community, the first thing every beginner does is... make a donut. It seems to be the easiest thing ever and it somehow became a de facto "Hello World" of the 3D modelling world.

It was my first ever model and I was literally on cloud nine when I got onto the material shading stage. It was oh so exciting.
